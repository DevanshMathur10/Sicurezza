Provides safety for Indian women at night with live location tracker and SOS sender.

Safety has been a major concern for Indian women for many years. Womenfeel unsafe not only outside but inside their homes as well. A few places inIndia have horrific conditions where women feel intimidated to even stepout of their house when it gets dark. Even today, in a world where womenare at par with men in every field, safety is a big problem.

We created an app which can be beneficial to women going out at any time of the day. Its features are:

• Live location tracker available for trusted members (emergency contacts).

• SOS Button : If the user presses the SOS button a notification will be sent to the trusted contacts immediately indicating the coordinates of the curent position of the user.

• Available option to report any case of adversity e.g. domestic violence etc.

• Areas with traffic and safe areas like the hospital and police station and unsafe areas(abandoned areas) marked on the map.
